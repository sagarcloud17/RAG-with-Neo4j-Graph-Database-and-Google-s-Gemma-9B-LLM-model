# RAG-with-Neo4j-Graph-Database-and-Google-s-Gemma2-9B-LLM-model
This repository showcases an innovative implementation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using the Neo4J graph database and Google's Gemma-2 9B Large Language Model (LLM). This approach leverages the strengths of both technologies to generate high-quality outputs

Key Components:
Neo4J Graph Database: Stores and manages knowledge graphs for efficient retrieval
Gemma-2 9B LLM: Provides advanced language understanding and text generation capabilities via the Groq API
Google Colab: Serves as the coding platform for this implementation

Implementation Overview:
We utilize Neo4J to store and query knowledge graphs, enabling efficient retrieval of relevant information
The Gemma-2 9B LLM is called using the Groq API, generating outputs based on the retrieved information and users query
This implementation demonstrates the potential of combining graph databases with LLMs for augmented generation tasks
